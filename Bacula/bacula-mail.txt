/usr/sbin/bsmtp


CONFIGURATION
       These commands should each appear on a single line in the configuration file.

       Messages {
         Name = Standard
         mailcommand = "/home/bacula/bin/bsmtp -h mail.domain.com -f \"\(Bacula\) \<%r\>\"
                                  -s \"Bacula: %t %e of %c %l\" %r"
         operatorcommand = "/home/bacula/bin/bsmtp -h mail.domain.com -f \"\(Bacula\) \<%r\>\"
                                        -s \"Bacula: Intervention needed for %j\" %r"
         mail = sysadmin@site.domain.com = all, !skipped
         operator = sysop@site.domain.com = mount
         console = all, !skipped, !saved
        }

       home/bacula/bin  is replaced with the path to the Bacula binary directory, and mail.domain.com is replaced with the fully qualified name of
       an SMTP server, which usually listen on port 25.

ENVIRONMENT
       If the -h option is not specified, bsmtp will use environment variable SMTPSERVER, or 'localhost' if not set.

NOTES
       Since bsmtp always uses a TCP connection rather than writing to a spool file, you may find  that  your  From:  address  is  being  rejected
       because  it does not contain a valid domain, or because your message has gotten caught in spam filtering rules. Generally, you should spec‐
       ify a fully qualified domain name in the from field, and depending on whether your SMTP gateway is Exim or Sendmail, you may need to modify
       the syntax of the from part of the message.

       If bsmtp cannot connect to the specified mail host, it will retry to connect to localhost.

BUGS
       If  you are getting incorrect dates (e.g. 1970) and you are running with a non-English locale, you might try setting the LANG="en_US" envi‐
       ronment variable.

# Reasonable message delivery -- send most everything to email address
#  and to the console
Messages {
  Name = Standard
#
# NOTE! If you send to two email or more email addresses, you will need
#  to replace the %r in the from field (-f part) with a single valid
#  email address in both the mailcommand and the operatorcommand.
#  What this does is, it sets the email address that emails would display
#  in the FROM field, which is by default the same email as they're being
#  sent to.  However, if you send email to more than one address, then
#  you'll have to set the FROM address manually, to a single address.
#  for example, a 'no-reply@mydomain.com', is better since that tends to
#  tell (most) people that its coming from an automated source.
