Just do the following in /etc/default/portmap to stop portmap from listening on the external interface:

# If you want portmap to listen only to the loopback
# interface, uncomment the following line (it will be
# uncommented automatically if you configure this
# through debconf).
OPTIONS="-i 127.0.0.1"

Then do:

/etc/init.d/portmap restart
